# RIP
A Death-Alternative Mod for Daggerfall Unity


Daggerfall is an amazingly immersive experience. But you know what would make it even more immersive? If you had true consequences for dying. This provides that service. Now when you die instead of seeing the gameover screen you are wisked back to a safe spot, usually the last tavern you visited. But beware! For now you are naked and afraid!

# Features  
This mod provides many configurable options for what happens upon dying. Features include:  
*Lives Counter - When you run out, it really is game over!
*Random chance for GameOver on death.
*Drop some or all of your gear where you died. 
*Drop some or all of your inventory where you died. Even your horse, cart, spellbook, and quest items can be dropped!
*Drop gold where you died!
*Time limit before your corpse rots away and you loose everything!
*Limit to the number of corpses that can be left behind! Don't fall into a death loop of carelessness!
*Respawn at the last Tavern you visited. Or even last tavern you rented! Now renting rooms has a purpose when preparing for adventure!
*And more!

Not Yet Implemented:  
*Loose XP on death.

# Compatibility  
This mod has been reasonbly well tested with a clean version of Daggerfall Unity. However due to the way it injects its features there is a decidedly good chance that certain mods can cause issues. The three mostly like are:
*Any mod that reduces stats at startup. If a stat hits zero this can potentially cause a deathloop that instantly ends everything.
*Any mod that requires the default GameOver functionality to work.
*Any mod that attempts to override the GameOver functionality in a way similar to this mod.
*Mods that alter terrain can cause issues too. Especially if you change this mod for an already started playthrough. It can leave your respawn location in an invalid state where you'll be far underground or miles high in the sky.

# Disclaimer  
This mod is unfinished work. While I enjoyed my time with DFU and found this mod both fun to make and to play with, other matters became more pressing and I've not had time to return to it. As a result it is still somewhat buggy and missing some important features. Perhaps oneday I'll return to it. Or perhaps another hand will touch the beacon.
